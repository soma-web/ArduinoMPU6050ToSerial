Arduino Uno and MPU-6050

To run this project, the hardware needs to be wired.

- Connect the VCC on the MPU6050 to 3.3V or 5V on Arduino.
- Connect the GND on the MPU6050 to the GND on the Arduino.
- Connect the SCL pin to analog pin 5.
- Connect the SDA pin to analog pin 4.
- Connect the INT pin to digital pin 2.
- Write the project to the Arduino.
- Connect using a baudrate of 38400.
